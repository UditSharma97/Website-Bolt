Project Overview
This project implements an AI-powered web application called Aptitude Solver, designed to help engineering students solve aptitude problems efficiently. The application features a conversational interface where users can ask questions related to quantitative aptitude, logical reasoning, and verbal ability. It responds with concise solutions by default, but users can request detailed step-by-step explanations when needed. The chatbot's problem-solving logic is grounded in C++.

The entire application was built using no-code tools, particularly the Bolt platform, and was deployed using Netlify. It demonstrates how AI and prompt engineering can be used to build intelligent educational tools without traditional coding.

Project Features
🤖 AI Chatbot:
Solves aptitude problems related to:

Quantitative aptitude

Logical reasoning

Verbal ability

Solutions are concise by default

Users can request extended explanations if needed

Solutions are explained using C++ logic

🧠 Prompt-Based Design:
Entire behavior driven using structured Markdown prompts

Responses formatted clearly for better readability

Follows a “conversational assistant” style

🔒 User Experience:
Clean interface

Minimal user input required

Easy access to learning through chat

🚀 Deployment:
Built on Bolt

Hosted live via Netlify

Technologies Used
Bolt – No-code platform used to build the chatbot with natural language prompts

Markdown Prompting – To define chatbot instructions and behaviors

Generative AI – For solving and generating human-like solutions to aptitude questions

Netlify – For live deployment of the application

Workshop Context
This app was built as part of a 2-day Generative AI Workshop organized by Outskill. Under the mentorship of Vaibhav Sisinty (Founder of Outskill), I learned how to:

Write effective prompts

Build apps using no-code AI tools like Bolt

Understand the fundamentals of AI product development

Deploy a fully functional app without writing a single line of code

Project Motivation
The goal was to apply newly learned skills in Generative AI and prompt engineering to build a useful app for students. Aptitude Solver serves as a proof-of-concept that AI can be harnessed for education in a low-code/no-code environment.


👨‍🏫 Workshop Mentor
Special thanks to Vaibhav Sisinty, founder of Outskill, whose practical teaching approach and prompt-writing techniques helped me gain hands-on experience in building and deploying this project.
