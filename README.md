🧠 Aptitude Solver
A no-code AI-powered website to solve aptitude questions for engineering students.

🚀 About This Project
This project was created as part of a 2-day Generative AI Online Workshop hosted by Outskill, where I learned how to build full-fledged web apps without writing a single line of code — using just structured prompting.

🛠️ How It Was Built
Under the guidance of Vaibhav Sisinty — the mentor and founder of Outskill — I explored how to create, design, and deploy applications using Bolt, a no-code AI website builder. Throughout the workshop, I learned:

The power of effective prompt engineering

How to convert ideas into working apps with no programming

How to deploy websites instantly

How to apply AI for real-world use cases like aptitude-solving

Using this knowledge, I created Aptitude Solver, a chatbot-based app that helps engineering students solve common aptitude questions. The core functionality is designed to give concise, relevant answers — and can expand on the solution if requested.

🌐 Live Deployment
The website has been deployed using Netlify, demonstrating the speed and simplicity of modern no-code tools.
