🧠 Aptitude Solver
An AI-powered web app designed to help engineering students quickly solve aptitude problems — built without writing a single line of code.

🎯 Purpose
Aptitude Solver was created as part of a 2-day Generative AI Workshop conducted by Outskill, where I learned how to turn ideas into functional apps using no-code AI tools and prompt engineering.

🧩 What I Learned
During the workshop, I learned:

🔹 How to write structured and effective prompts using Markdown formatting

🔹 How to build AI applications using Bolt — without coding

🔹 Real-world use cases of Generative AI in education and productivity

🔹 The end-to-end process of designing, building, and deploying web applications

🔹 How to iterate quickly using prompt-based development

🛠️ Tech & Tools Used
Bolt – for creating the app using prompt instructions

Netlify – for seamless deployment

Markdown Prompting – to structure chatbot behavior

AI Chatbot – specialized to solve aptitude questions in C++

CustomGPTs – to provide contextual and structured solutions

🤖 About the App
The Aptitude Solver app allows users (especially engineering students) to:

Solve standard aptitude problems (quantitative, logical, and verbal)

Get concise answers by default

Request detailed step-by-step explanations when needed

Interact with a chatbot trained specifically for aptitude topics

👨‍🏫 Workshop Mentor
Special thanks to Vaibhav Sisinty, founder of Outskill, whose practical teaching approach and prompt-writing techniques helped me gain hands-on experience in building and deploying this project.
